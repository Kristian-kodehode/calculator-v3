# Calculator Project

Task over the summer to create a calculator in React.
I did a couple of different ones, but landed on this one.
Also, i made this originally in React Native app just to try out, but moved it over to vite, thats why the commit history is basically non-existing.

Inspired by the iphone calculator..obviously , hehe.

This was a properly challenging project for me with logics.
I did make it in the end, but it was with the help from tutorials and also chat GPT. Practice is what i need, so practice is what iÂ´ll do!
This was a very early React project as well, so that combined with pretty complex logical thinking (for a beginner) is set up to be a challenging task.

All in all i am pleased with the result and it does work as intended.
