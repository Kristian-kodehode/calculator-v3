# Calculator Project

Task over the summer to create a calculator in React.
I did a couple of different ones, but landed on this one.
Also, i made this originally in React Native app just to try out, but moved it over to vite, thats why the commit history is basically non-existing.

Inspired by the iphone calculator..obviously , hehe.
